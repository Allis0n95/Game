Nyx haunts your nightmares and raises your deepest fears. You cannot sleep or rest. You hear a voice calling you in the middle of the night so you investigate. What else are you gonna do? Sleep??
Now at the edge of the dark forest, you peer into the trees and see Nyx's hut, which you know because it is labeled (for some reason). There is no choice but to approach and face your greatest fears so you can sleep again.
